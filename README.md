# Simple Python String Encryptor/Decryptor based on Caesar Shift

This is a simple Python program with 2 functions to encrypt and decrypt a String argument. The shift parameter key will shift the alphabet that many spaces and create the cypher dictionary which will allow for simple mapping of the alphabet list with cypher list. To decrypt the string, the arguments must be the encrypted String and the same shift key that was used for encryption.
